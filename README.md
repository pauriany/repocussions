# repocussions
Hello, I created this in order to house the QUIZ for today. I am honestly very nervous and working from a bathroom stall. Bare with me and pray!

Eric's feature seems to be greeting and checking in guests. This task seems fairly simple, but it will be using some extensive code from slide 26 as well as some Java. He is also expected to code a welcoming script and will be working between a remote and in person repository.
